\section{Lattice gauge theory}
        The main difference between Ising lattice and gauge lattice is that the variables of the second one are the links instead of the sites. In an 
        Ising gauge lattice the variables over the links can be only $\pm 1$. We are interested to 4-D Ising gauge lattice, so we will have three space-like coordinates
        and one time-like.
